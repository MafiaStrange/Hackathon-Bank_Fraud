# Hackathon-Bank_Fraud

The problem statement was to find whether a given transaction statement was fraudulent or not. We approached this problem by taking multiple datasets which identifies whether or not a transaction is legitimate based on the scale of amount, gender, age, bank balance of the participating entities.

We used two models for the same.. One using Logistic Regression and the other using XGBoost. Please find the datasets for the same by clicking the given link.
